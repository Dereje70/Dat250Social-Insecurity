# Dat250Social-Insecurity
Project1

I used OWASP to find the vulnerabilities in the application and have performed some configuration.
I begun by setting up local proxy in OWASP.

Then I copied the Dynamic SSL certificate from OWAASP and imporetd it in to my browser so that they work in harmony.

So, by using OWASP built in functionalities, I have found around 25 Vulnerabilities/Alerts (as seen on Vulnerability.jpg), which we can use to attack the web application
