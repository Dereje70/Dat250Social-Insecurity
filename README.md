# Dat250Social-Insecurity
**Project1

I used OWASP ZAP to uncover vulnerabilities and sitemaps in the application and have performed some configuration before performing scaning.
I begun by setting up local proxy in OWASP and enable some OWASP extensions.Then I set sup the local proxy in my browser to mach with the one I craeted in OWASP.

Then I copied the Dynamic SSL certificate from OWASP for the proper work of proxy in my browser and imporetd it in to my browser so that they work in harmony.

So, by using OWASP ZAP built in functionalities, I have found around 25 Vulnerabilities/Alerts (as seen on Vulnerabilities.jpg), which we can use to attack the web application.

After the scanning I do brutfore scan attacks and have got som payloads, whcih we can see on the attched pictures.
